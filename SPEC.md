Project Overview: AI-Native Command Bar

Concept: Develop an AI-first command bar application, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) as the core operating system, to significantly accelerate common user tasks. The primary goal is to help users execute simple, multi-step actions in moments, reducing the time spent on these tasks from approximately 10-15 seconds to near-instantaneous.User Experience (UX)

The application will feature a minimal, simple hovering command bar, activated instantly with a universal hotkey (e.g., Cmd + O).
Direct Command: Users can type a natural language command and press Enter for immediate execution.
Command Selection: Pressing Tab will present a list of pre-defined, high-value commands for selection before typing.
Core Functionality & Use Cases

The LLM-powered command bar will interpret intent to perform a wide range of tasks, including:
Organization: "Move the file I just downloaded to the proper directory."
Reminders: "Remind me of the 'xyz' meeting in 15 minutes."
Communication: "Craft a professional response to the message I just received on iMessage."
Media Control: "Change the current playlist to the 'Focus' mix."
Information Retrieval (Workspace): "Find the email that mentions my flight details."
Quick Capture: "Quick Note: 'Blah blah blah'."
Thought Organization: "I'm thinking about the Q3 strategy."
Web Search: "Check the current price of Bitcoin."
Calendar Management: "What meetings are on my calendar today?"
Technology & Roadmap

Implementation:
Development Platform: The initial application will be built as a native macOS application using the Tauri framework.
Workflow Definition: While key commands will be defined out-of-the-box, a crucial feature will be the ability for users to define and customize their own proprietary workflows by chaining commands.
Future Enhancements:
Mobile Synchronization: Develop a companion iOS mobile app to synchronize actions and data with the macOS application. This will allow users to quickly trigger actions on their MacBook from their phone or efficiently manage their information while mobile.
