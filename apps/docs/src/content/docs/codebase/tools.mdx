title: Tools
---

Tools are the LLM-facing interface that map to application actions or system functions.

## Responsibilities

- Provide core system tools (`search_extensions`, `get_extension`, `activate_extension`).
- Assemble the ToolSet for the active session.
- Proxy application tools into LLM-callable tools.

## Primary entrypoints

- `crates/cocommand/src/tool/registry.rs`
- `crates/cocommand/src/tool/search_extensions.rs`
- `crates/cocommand/src/tool/get_extension.rs`
- `crates/cocommand/src/tool/activate_extension.rs`

## How tools are assembled

- System tools are always inserted.
- Only tools for **active applications** are injected into the LLM toolset.
- Tool names are sanitized to match provider constraints (alphanumeric, `_`, `-`).

## Boundary notes

- Tool execution is delegated to the owning `Application` via `Application::execute`.
- The registry layer does not decide which tools to call; the LLM does.
