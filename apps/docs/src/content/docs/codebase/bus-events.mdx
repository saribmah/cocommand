title: Bus and Events
---

The bus provides in-process event broadcasting and is exposed via SSE for external consumers.

## Responsibilities

- Allow async publish/subscribe of events inside the server.
- Provide a simple SSE stream at `/events`.

## Primary entrypoints

- `crates/cocommand/src/bus.rs`
- `crates/cocommand/src/server/events.rs`

## Event model

- Events are `Any + Send + Sync` and stored as `Arc<dyn Any>`.
- SSE payloads include the Rust type name for the event.
- A keep-alive is sent every 15 seconds.

## Boundary notes

- The bus is in-process only (no persistence, no cross-process delivery).
