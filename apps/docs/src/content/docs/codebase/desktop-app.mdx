title: Desktop App (React)
---

The desktop UI is a React app that renders the command bar, results, and settings. It communicates with the backend via HTTP and uses Tauri only for windowing and server info.

## Responsibilities

- Render the command bar and result panels.
- Provide application picker (`@`) and settings UI.
- Store server/session/application state in client stores.

## Primary entrypoints

- `apps/desktop/src/App.tsx`
- `apps/desktop/src/components/CommandBar.tsx`
- `apps/desktop/src/components/ApplicationPicker.tsx`
- `apps/desktop/src/views/settings/SettingsView.tsx`

## State management

- `apps/desktop/src/state/server.ts`: server info and health.
- `apps/desktop/src/state/session.ts`: send message + session context.
- `apps/desktop/src/state/applications.ts`: list/open applications.
- `apps/desktop/src/state/commandbar.ts`: local UI state for input and results.

## Backend integration

- The UI fetches server status and address from Tauri via `getServerStatus()`.
- All core actions are HTTP calls to the backend server.

## Boundary notes

- The UI does not call Rust core directly.
- Window management is handled by the Tauri layer.
