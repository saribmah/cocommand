title: Session
---

Sessions capture the current user context window and manage active applications.

## Responsibilities

- Create and persist session metadata.
- Roll over sessions based on configured duration.
- Maintain a per-session application cache.

## Primary entrypoints

- `crates/cocommand/src/session/manager.rs`
- `crates/cocommand/src/session/session.rs`
- `crates/cocommand/src/session/application_cache.rs`

## Key types

- `SessionManager`: owns the active session and performs rollover on access.
- `Session`: session metadata and application cache for the active window.
- `ApplicationCache`: TTL cache of active applications.

## Notes

- `SessionManager::with_session_mut` is the primary access point for session-bound operations.
- Sessions are stored under `storage/session/<workspace_id>/<session_id>.json`.
