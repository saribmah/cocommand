title: Applications
---

Applications are the units of functionality that tools are scoped to. They can be built-in, installed system apps, or future extensions.

## Responsibilities

- Define application metadata and available tools.
- Execute tool calls in a platform-specific way.
- Provide a registry for listing and lookup.

## Primary entrypoints

- `crates/cocommand/src/application.rs`
- `crates/cocommand/src/application/registry.rs`
- `crates/cocommand/src/application/installed.rs`
- `crates/cocommand/src/application/note.rs`

## Key types

- `Application` trait: `id`, `name`, `kind`, `tags`, `tools`, `execute`.
- `ApplicationTool`: schema-based tool definition.
- `ApplicationContext`: workspace and session metadata passed to tools.
- `ApplicationRegistry`: shared application collection.

## Boundary notes

- Applications are registered inside the workspace, not at the server level.
- Installed apps use `platform-macos` for listing and AppleScript execution.
