title: Tauri Shell
---

The Tauri shell owns window management and backend server lifecycle. It is the only bridge between the UI and Rust core.

## Responsibilities

- Resolve the workspace directory under the app data path.
- Start the backend server and hold the handle.
- Expose minimal IPC commands to the UI.
- Toggle and manage application windows.

## Primary entrypoints

- `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/lib.rs`
- `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/state.rs`
- `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/commands.rs`
- `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/window.rs`

## IPC surface

- `get_server_info_cmd`: server address + workspace dir.
- `open_settings_window`, `hide_settings_window`, `hide_window`.
- Workspace path commands for future configuration updates.

## Boundary notes

- The Tauri layer does not handle session, tools, or LLM logic.
- Once the server starts, the UI talks to the backend over HTTP.
