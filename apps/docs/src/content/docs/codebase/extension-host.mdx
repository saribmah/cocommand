title: Extension Host
---

The extension host is a Deno process that loads external extensions and exposes them over JSON-RPC.

## Responsibilities

- Load an extension bundle from disk.
- Provide a JSON-RPC 2.0 interface over stdin/stdout.
- Execute extension tool handlers and return results.

## Primary entrypoints

- `apps/extension-host/main.ts`
- `apps/extension-host/loader.ts`
- `apps/extension-host/protocol.ts`

## Protocol

- Requests are newline-delimited JSON-RPC messages.
- Supported methods: `initialize`, `invoke_tool`, `shutdown`.
- The host currently runs one extension per process.

## Boundary notes

- The extension host is not wired into the backend yet; it is a standalone runtime.
