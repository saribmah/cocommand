This crate encapsulates macOS-specific functionality for installed apps and AppleScript execution.

## Responsibilities

- Enumerate installed applications from common macOS app directories.
- Open installed applications by bundle id or path.
- Provide AppleScript tooling and execution.

## Primary entrypoints

- `crates/platform-macos/src/lib.rs`

## Key functions

- `list_installed_apps()`: scans `/Applications`, `/System/Applications`, and user apps.
- `open_installed_app(bundle_id, path)`: launches via `open`.
- `installed_app_tools()`: returns tool definitions for installed apps.
- `execute_installed_app_tool()`: runs AppleScript actions.

## Boundary notes

- The core application layer calls into this crate via `InstalledApplication`.
- Non-macOS platforms do not use this crate.
